HTML-CSS - > Create a static form UI using only HTML and CSS. Include fields for full name, email, password, and confirm password. Add a button to toggle password visibility, a progress bar showing form completeness, and a checklist of requirements. The form won't be functional yet but can be enhanced with JavaScript later.
